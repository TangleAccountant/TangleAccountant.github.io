            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> My friends call me worden and I used to work in an accounting department at a large company. </p>
            <p> This site exists because I have an unhealthy obsession with finance. My favorite definition of finance has always been "the art and science of managing money.
            Art AND Science. </p>
               <p> There's a lot to unpack there. But for now all you need to know is that I started my career interested in corporate finance. That evolved into 
                personal finance. And once that was tapped out I moved onto decentralized finance. Each of these coexist with each other in such a neat way. Hopefully I can 
                look back on these pages when I'm older and see where everything went right or where it all went wrong.

            <h2>Accounting Jokes</h2>
            <p> A long time ago I wrote and published a book called "Financial Jokes for Financial Folks." I created a page on here so anybody can read them for free 
            if they're deep into accounting and want a cheap laugh. </p>
            <p> Buy the book if you want to give it away as a gag gift or something. </p>
