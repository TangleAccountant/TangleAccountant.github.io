            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> This site exists because I have an unhealthy obsession with finance. My favorite definition of finance has always been "the art and science of managing money." </p>
            <p><strong> Art AND Science. </strong></p>
            <p> A beautiful balance. All you need to know is that I started my journey interested in corporate finance. That evolved into
                personal finance. And once that was capped out I moved onto decentralized finance. All 3 of these domains have a direct impact on your life, whether you realize it or not. Hopefully I can look back on these pages when I'm older and see where everything went right or where it all went wrong.
            </p>
            <p> I also build software and games, which is where <a href="zen-poke/index.html">Zen Poke</a> comes in.</p>

            <h2> Latest Posts On What's Currently Tickling My Fancy </h2>
            <p> Writing things down helps to better synthesize and articulate new ideas. These posts are mostly used to map out investmnent theses that I believe have a good shot of playing out. If I'm not capable of writing an entire article on why I should buy something, I probably shouldn't buy it. </p>
            <p> Not limited to investment posts. </p>

            <h2> Zen Poke </h2>
            <p> Zen Poke is a portrait-first mobile needle-felting puzzle game I am building for iOS and Android in Unity.</p>
            <p> The current release plan includes optional ads for non-entitled users and a one-time remove-ads purchase. The core gameplay loop is designed to be offline-first.</p>
            <p> This site now hosts the app's public information, support, privacy policy, and legal pages needed for store and ad network onboarding.</p>

            <h2>Accounting Jokes</h2>
            <p> A long time ago I wrote and published a book called "Financial Jokes for Financial Folks." <a href="accountingjokes/index.html">I created a page on here</a> so anybody can read them for free
            if they're deep into accounting and want a cheap laugh. </p>
            <p> Buy the book on Amazon by clicking it below if you want to give it away as a gag gift or something. </p>
