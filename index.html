            <h2>About</h2>
            <p> This site exists because I have an unhealthy obsession with finance. My favorite definition of finance has always been "the art and science of managing money." </p>
            <p><strong> Art AND Science. </strong></p>
            <p> A beautiful balance. All you need to know is that I started my journey interested in corporate finance. That evolved into 
                personal finance. And once that was capped out I moved onto decentralized finance. All 3 of these domains have a direct impact on your life, whether you realize it or not. Hopefully I can look back on these pages when I'm older and see where everything went right or where it all went wrong.

            <p> Writing things down helps to better synthesize and articulate new ideas. These posts are mostly used to map out investmnent theses that I believe have a good shot of playing out. If I'm not capable of writing an entire article on why I should buy something, I probably shouldn't buy it. </p>
            <p> Not limited to investment posts. </p>

            <h2>Accounting Jokes</h2>
            <p> A long time ago I wrote and published a book called "Financial Jokes for Financial Folks." <a href="accountingjokes/index.html">I created a page on here</a> so anybody can read them for free 
            if they're deep into accounting and want a cheap laugh. </p>
            <p> Buy the book on Amazon by clicking it below if you want to give it away as a gag gift or something. </p>
