            <h1>Privacy Policy for Zen Poke</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-content">
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Zen Poke (the "App") and the Zen Poke pages on funnymanfinance.com may collect, use, and share information when the App is released for iOS and Android.</p>

            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>This policy applies to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Zen Poke mobile app</li>
                <li>The Zen Poke app page, support page, and related pages on funnymanfinance.com</li>
                <li>Communications sent to Zen Poke support</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>Zen Poke is currently planned as a general audience app (13+) and is not intended to be directed to children under 13.</p>

            <h2>3. Information We May Collect</h2>
            <p>Depending on the final release configuration, Zen Poke may collect or process the following categories of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device and app diagnostics (such as app version, platform, crash context, and performance/reliability data)</li>
                <li>Gameplay and analytics events (for example, session, navigation, and puzzle progress telemetry)</li>
                <li>Support request information you voluntarily send us by email (such as device details and issue descriptions)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We may use information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operate and improve the app</li>
                <li>Diagnose bugs, crashes, and performance problems</li>
                <li>Measure feature quality and gameplay experience</li>
                <li>Respond to support requests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Release Configuration and Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Zen Poke is still in development, and the final production service configuration may change before launch. This website and policy will be updated before release to reflect the services actually used in the shipped build.</p>
            <p>Depending on the final release configuration, the app may use third-party services for analytics, crash reporting, or other operational support.</p>

            <h2>6. Platform Services</h2>
            <p>Zen Poke may be distributed through mobile platform providers such as Apple App Store and/or Google Play. Those platforms may process app distribution, updates, and other platform-level functions under their own terms and policies.</p>

            <h2>7. Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>We may share information with service providers only as needed to operate Zen Poke, such as mobile platform providers (Apple, Google), analytics tools, crash reporting tools, and other services used in the release build.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to operate, secure, support, and improve the app, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes.</p>

            <h2>9. Your Choices and Requests</h2>
            <p>You can contact us to ask privacy questions or request help regarding support data you submitted by email. Contact: <a href="mailto:wordena16@gmail.com">wordena16@gmail.com</a></p>
            <p class="small-note">Privacy and support requests for Zen Poke are handled through this email and the Zen Poke support page.</p>

            <h2>10. Security</h2>
            <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical measures appropriate to a small indie app operation, but no system can guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.</p>
