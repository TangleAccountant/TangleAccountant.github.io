            <h1>Privacy Policy for Zen Poke</h1>
            <p>Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-content">
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Zen Poke (the "App") and the Zen Poke pages on funnymanfinance.com may collect, use, and share information when the App is released for iOS and Android.</p>

            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>This policy applies to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Zen Poke mobile app</li>
                <li>The Zen Poke app page, support page, and related pages on funnymanfinance.com</li>
                <li>Communications sent to Zen Poke support</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>Zen Poke is currently planned as a general audience app (13+) and is not intended to be directed to children under 13.</p>

            <h2>3. Information We May Collect</h2>
            <p>Depending on the final release configuration, Zen Poke may collect or process the following categories of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Device and app diagnostics (such as app version, platform, crash context, and performance/reliability data)</li>
                <li>Gameplay and analytics events (for example, session, navigation, puzzle progress, and monetization event telemetry)</li>
                <li>Advertising-related identifiers or device signals used by ad networks, if ads are enabled in the release build</li>
                <li>Purchase state / entitlement information needed to support the one-time Remove Ads purchase</li>
                <li>Support request information you voluntarily send us by email (such as device details and issue descriptions)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We may use information to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operate and improve the app</li>
                <li>Diagnose bugs, crashes, and performance problems</li>
                <li>Measure feature quality and gameplay experience</li>
                <li>Serve and manage ads (if enabled in the final release)</li>
                <li>Validate and restore a Remove Ads purchase entitlement</li>
                <li>Respond to support requests</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Advertising and Monetization</h2>
            <p>Zen Poke's current release plan includes ads for non-entitled users and a one-time Remove Ads purchase. If ads are enabled in the production build, ad partners may collect or receive device and usage information as permitted by their SDKs and applicable law.</p>
            <p>This website and policy will be updated before launch to reflect the final production advertising and analytics providers. The project currently includes AppLovin MAX integration planning, but the exact release configuration may change before public launch.</p>

            <h2>6. In-App Purchases</h2>
            <p>Purchases in Zen Poke (including the planned one-time Remove Ads purchase) are processed by Apple and/or Google, not directly by this website. We may receive limited purchase status or entitlement information needed to unlock or restore app features.</p>

            <h2>7. Sharing of Information</h2>
            <p>We may share information with service providers only as needed to operate Zen Poke, such as mobile platform providers (Apple, Google), payment systems, analytics tools, crash reporting tools, and ad mediation / advertising partners used in the release build.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary to operate, secure, support, and improve the app, comply with legal obligations, and resolve disputes.</p>

            <h2>9. Your Choices and Requests</h2>
            <p>You can contact us to ask privacy questions or request help regarding support data you submitted by email. Contact: <a href="mailto:support@funnymanfinance.com">support@funnymanfinance.com</a></p>
            <p class="small-note">Replace this placeholder support email before launch.</p>

            <h2>10. Security</h2>
            <p>We use reasonable administrative and technical measures appropriate to a small indie app operation, but no system can guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.</p>

            <h2>12. Contact</h2>
