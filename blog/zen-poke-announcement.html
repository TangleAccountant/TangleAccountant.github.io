    <main class="blog-content">
        <p>Zen Poke is a portrait-first mobile needle-felting puzzle game I am building in Unity for iOS and Android. The goal is simple: make a relaxing, tactile-feeling puzzle experience that is easy to pick up and satisfying to finish.</p>

        <p>This is a real production buildout project, not just a weekend prototype. Right now the focus is on a polished mobile shell, a stronger gameplay feel pass, and release-ready quality for the basic progression surfaces.</p>

        <h2>What Zen Poke Is</h2>
        <p>The game is designed around portrait gameplay and a cozy needle-felting theme. The current shell emphasizes touch ergonomics, calm pacing, and a smooth mobile UX that feels good to interact with.</p>

        <p>I am intentionally keeping the scope focused. The priority is shipping something that feels good in your hands, performs reliably, and can be improved over time.</p>

        <h2>Why I Am Building It</h2>
        <p>Zen Poke is currently in development. Store listings for iOS and Android are not live yet.</p>

        <p>The bigger goal is to build something that helps you settle your mind. I want Zen Poke to feel like a healthy break from endless scrolling: a calm, tactile puzzle experience that lowers the noise instead of spiking your stress.</p>

        <h2>Why This Is On Funny Man Finance</h2>
        <p>This site started as a finance and jokes corner of the internet. It is now also the public home for my software and game projects. I wanted to keep the existing content and personality while adding the pieces needed to support a real app launch.</p>

        <p>More Zen Poke updates will show up here as the project moves toward release.</p>
