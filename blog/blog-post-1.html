        <p>A common passive income strategy is to self-publish books, e-books, and audiobooks. In this article I’m going to show you how I went from having no idea how to write a book to self-publishing a joke book on Amazon and making over $1,000 in a single month.</p>

        <p> I’ve always been a pretty weird guy. Nobody has ever walked up to me and said, “Wow, you seem like a really normal person.” One of my unique characteristics has always been my obsession with retiring early. There’s a million ways to get there, and at the rate I’m going, I’ll probably test most of them out. Some are bound to make you over $1,000 in one month! </p>

        <p> One of my recent endeavors: Writing a book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Financial-Jokes-Folks-Accounting-Finance/dp/1689761660">Financial Jokes for Financial Folks</a>). </p>

        <p> No joke. This really did happen. </p>

        <p><i> At a royalty rate of $2.04 for every copy sold, I made $1,151.56 from Financial Jokes for Financial Folks in December 2019 </i></p>

        <h2> How I Came Up With The Idea of Self-Publishing a Book </h2>

        <p> It all started back in August 2019 when I began to build my website, Funny Man Finance. My goal was a pretty simple one: Create a funny website with accounting and finance jokes on it that would give me a platform to write about my various investing shenanigans (in hopes that people could learn from, or improve upon, my mistakes). </p>

        <p> After I spent a few days building the bones of my website I needed some accounting jokes to add to one of my pages. I figured I could just borrow some off the internet. There must be dozens of websites with thousands of accounting jokes, right? </p>

        <p> Wrong. </p>

        <p> I was, as an accountant who loves making jokes, super surprised that I had trouble finding more than a couple dozen unique (and funny) jokes on the internet that had to do with accounting. Based on my findings I knew one of two things had to be true: </p>

        <ol>
            <li> There are no accounting jokes because there’s no demand for accounting jokes </li>
            <li> We’ve got ourselves a market for accounting jokes that needs to be filled </li>
        </ol>

        <p> Being the guy that I am, and not wanting to believe that the world doesn’t need more jokes related to accounting and finance, I decided to take a day off of work, print off a sheet of 200 financial terms and definitions, and proceeded to use those terms as a guide, and write over 100 financial jokes. </p>

        <img class="blog-image" src="../images/blog_how_i_made_over_1000_1.jpg" alt="Self-publishing process" loading="lazy">

        <p> Of those 100 jokes, I ended up keeping about 40 of them. After that I decided that a better way to write jokes would be to write one joke each day at work, on a large piece of paper, and display it on a stand for everybody walking by to see. </p>

        <p> Based on the number of laughs I ended up getting, I’d either place it in the funny pile or in my shredder bin. </p>

        <p> And I’m not saying that I’m great joke writer, but I’m pretty good at making people cringe after I tell them one of my jokes. And that was kind of the point all along. To make corny accounting and finance jokes. </p>

        <p> Now that I had a laundry list of funny material at my disposal, I could finally create my accounting and finance jokes page on Funny Man Finance. </p>

        <p> Around that same time, a co-worker of mine brought a joke book into the office that she had bought off Amazon. It was a dad joke book, and she would read some of the jokes during our team meetings and everybody loved it. </p>

        <p> These jokes were in the same exact format as my jokes. A simple question followed-up by a punchline. The gears in my head started turning: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Are there any accounting or finance joke books on Amazon right now?</li>
            <li>If there was a financial joke book on Amazon, would people actually buy it?</li>
            <li>Can anybody publish a book on Amazon?</li>
            <li>I wonder how much money I could make if I wrote my own joke book…</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Turns out there was only one accounting or finance related joke book on Amazon, and it only had 1 review… and it was for 2 stars. There clearly wasn’t a lot of competition in this space and since I’m a firm believer that all accountants are hilarious, I decided to move forward with writing Financial Jokes for Financial Folks. </p>

        <h2> How I Published a Book on Amazon </h2>

        <p> I know what you’re thinking, “Stories are all well and fun, but how exactly do I make over $1,000 a month by self-publishing a book?” Let me take you through, and explain step-by-step, how to: </p>
